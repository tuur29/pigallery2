> ! This repo is a fork of [barry-luijten fork](https://github.com/barry-luijten/pigallery2) of [PiGallery2](https://github.com/bpatrik/pigallery2) with these edits:

- Dark theme (kudos to [barry-luijten fork](https://github.com/barry-luijten/pigallery2)), I only changed the tint and made it the default
- Use [lightgallery.js](https://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightgallery.js/) instead of the default lightbox
- Disabled all languages except English to speed up build time significantly
- Ignore demo images to test own galleries instead of default demo images
